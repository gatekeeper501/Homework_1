## Reflection

This course is giving me the foundational skills needed to work effectively in modern development teams. Understanding Git and GitHub isn't just about code management, it's about being part of a collaborative community where everyone's contributions are tracked, valued, and merged together into something greater.

As I continue my journey toward a Ph.D. in Computer Science, these collaboration skills will be essential for research projects, team development, and contributing to the broader tech community.
